JS Helps:
	- // comment. multiline /* */
	- escape marks \"if we want to place quotation mark"\
	- to use function just type it example function name_of_func(){}
	- Variable:
		global-outside the function
		lokal- inside the function
CSS:
	-Matrix transformation 2D transform: matrix(1,2,3,4,5,6)
	is a key to use this as the all function in css to Screw, rotate, scale, translate
	 * 1 and 4 is scale (1=X ,4=Y)
	 * 2 and 3 is scraw can work as rotate if it was the negative (2=horizontal, 3=vetical changes)
	 * 4 and 5 work as transform (4=(+)right/(-)left, 5=(+)down/(-)Up)
